            <p>Games Done Quick, also known as GDQ, is a week long, biannual event where thousands of people come together to watch some of the best speedrunners in the world. Runners come to perform live in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers, which come from a mix of both the in-person attendees and those watching online through twitch, an online streaming platform.<br>

            <br>Runners who are selected to participate in a GDQ event are offered a time slot to run their specific game and category. Along with their chosen commentators, runners will give detailed explanations of the tricks and techniques they perform in their run, while also sharing their insight on the game, the community, their highs and lows, and funny stories they've had along the way to be one of the best speedrunners in their community.<br>

            <br>These events often feature games from the most popular speedrunning categories. Whether it be a Super Mario, Legend of Zelda, or Super Metroid title, there will always be an entertaining speedrun to watch! Even if you know nothing about the game, you will learn quickly how a speedrunner takes advantage of glitches in a game to get the fastest time possible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="gdqcol">

            <p>What makes speedrunning such a profitable charity event is its ability to appeal to anyone in its audience. They often such an incredible variety of video games that there will always be something that appeals to the viewer, whether they've played the game before or it simply just looks interesting. GDQ also offers donation incentives, which enable viewers to bid money on certain rare collectables, file names, or to put money towards a game they would like to see run at GDQ. If enough money is donated, a fan favorite speedrun can be picked and get run live during the event. There's nothing more exciting then seeing the donations go up and seeing your favorite game get chosen to speedrun last minute. All money donated during this event (millions!) gets sent to some non profit or charity such as the Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

    <p>GDQ also benefits from hosting races between speedrunners. This offers viewers something fresh to watch, and it can be thrilling to see two of the best runners in the world compete in realtime right next to each other.</p>

    <p>Hosting events like GDQ offers the chance for runners to meet up with their fellow community members in-person, which otherwise would be a challenging task. It's difficult for online communities to find opportunities to meet up in-person, so having events like GDQ that encourage connection have a positive effect on everyone who attends.</p> 

    <p>At the most recent event, donations have totaled over 3.4 million dollars during the week-long event, donating all of its profits to the Malala fund. The next GDQ event will begin June 26th, 2022, which will take place in-person at Bloomington, Minnesota and online at the <strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Games Done Quick</a></strong> twitch channel.</p>
